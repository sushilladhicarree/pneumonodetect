# Pneumonia Detection

This project is designed to detect pneumonia from medical images using machine learning techniques.

## Features

- Automated detection of pneumonia from chest X-ray images.
- Utilizes deep learning models for high accuracy.
- Easy-to-use interface for uploading and analyzing images.
